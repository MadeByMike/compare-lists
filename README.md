Compare Lists
=============
What stated as a quick project to play with web workers proved to be more useful.

This little app as the name suggests allows you to compare lists and find: 
* items in list 1 but not in list 2
* items in list 2 but not in list 1
* items in either list but not in both
* items in both lists

The app makes use of web workers to process large lists but will work with older browsers and Internet Explorer.

Note: The GitHub files uses inline web workers so that it will work on the local file system.
